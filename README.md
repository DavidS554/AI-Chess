# AI-Chess
My AI chess bot will learn from scratch, given only the rules. Unlike Stockfish, it won’t use past games but instead play against itself, evolving over time. It will simulate years of human play in weeks, learning efficient strategies. After generations, I’ll test it by comparing its moves with Stockfish to see its growth.
